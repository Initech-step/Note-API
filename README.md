# PROJECT NAME: Note app


## Reason/Purpose why this project was developed
Short note taking is part of daily human activities. This software helps you take notes.
This project was built as my first mini fullstack implementation.

Developed by: Ini-abasi Sebastian Etim


### Technical Structure

This app is divided into two different sections which are 'the frontend' and 'the backend'. 

#### The frontend stack
- HTML -CSS -Bootstrap -JS -Vue
#### The backend stack
- Python -Django -Django Rest Framework 

The purpose of the frontend is to illustrate and give easy interaction with the REST API implementation of the APP.The main focus is on the REST API implementation.


# How to set up this project.

I reccommend you start by setting up the backend.
Instructions can be found in the README.md in the backend folder, same applies to the 'frontend/note_app/'.

Access the application from the frontend.
